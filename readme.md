# Project Title

Kew Gardens 3D model project for Kay Rogage

# Author:

## About The Hardware

[Kew Gardens 3D Model Project]
The hardware has sensors that are used for gathering Temperature, Humidity and eCO2 data that is then sent to a thingspeak server using an api that stores the data to be retrieved by the website

## Technologies

We used `Arduino C`

## Setup

- setup router with wifi ssid: test and password: testing123 this is for the prototype
- plug the microcontroller into the power
  The microcontroller will automatically connect to wifi and push data to the thing speak server every 30 seconds. Time will be extended for production.
